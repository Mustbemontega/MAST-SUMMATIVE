This is my summative version of the Christoffels Menu App for the MAST5112 module. the purpose of the app is to help a chef manage a restaurant menu by allowing them to add, view, sort, and remove dishes. i built it using React Native with TypeScript in Visual Studio Code.
the app has two main screens. on the home screen, the chef can see all the menu items, the total number of dishes, and the average price per course. the home screen also has options to sort the dishes by course or price and, in this version, I added a new filter bar that allows the chef to view only Starters, Mains, Desserts, or all dishes together. the second screen is for adding and removing dishes. the chef can enter a dish name, description, select a course, and set a price.
for the summative update, I made two main improvements. the first was adding a filter bar that lets the user filter menu items by course. this makes it easier to view each category separately. the second update was adding a restaurant name in a bright color on the top left corner of the screen. it’s not a logo, but it gives the app a more personal and branded look.
everything else from Part 2 stayed the same. the color theme, fade-in animation, sorting features, and calculations all still work as before. the app stores data temporarily in an array, since the focus was on building the logic and user interface rather than permanent storage.
i tested the app on the Android emulator, and all features work as expected. the app feels smoother, more complete, and closer to what a real restaurant would use to organize their menu.
this project was created by me, Bontle Sekhukhune (ST10471542), for the MAST5112 App Development summative assessment.
